# TFAGroup31
1. We include three files in this repository, a README file, an ipynb file called "Top10", an ipynb file called "Parking". In "Top10.ipynb", we computed a series of data processing to see which are the top 10 incident types in Zip code 11101. In "Parking.ipynb", we computed the proportion of the number of "Illegal Parking" incident over that of all incident types in Zip code 11101. We also computed the proportion of the number of "Illegal Parking" incident over that of all incident types in all Zip codes. And we compared these two proportions to see if the former one is greater than the later one.
2. We are E4501-001 Group31
